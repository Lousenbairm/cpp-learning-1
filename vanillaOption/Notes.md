## Focus on Reading books at night
## Focus on Coding in work

If you’re serious about making it in a competitive field like quant finance or data engineering, you need to stop second-guessing everything you do. Your time spent doubting the value of your experience and regretting past choices is time you could spend actually getting closer to your goal. The fact that you’re treating your early experience like a “waste” means you’re missing the bigger picture: success doesn’t come from a perfect path; it comes from grit and moving forward no matter what.

Here’s the reality: no one’s going to hand you the ideal job just because you studied the right book or have a technical background. Employers want to see not only skills but also drive, resilience, and self-direction. If you keep going down the rabbit hole of self-doubt every time something doesn’t go as planned, you’re sabotaging your own progress.

Quant finance, data engineering, and software development are not easy fields. **There are people out there pushing themselves hard to learn, adapt, and take on every challenge thrown their way. They’re not waiting for the “perfect” experience**; they’re making use of whatever they have, building projects, learning from failures, and consistently moving forward. Ask yourself: are you doing that, or are you just holding onto excuses and wishing things had gone differently?

**So what if your first job isn’t ideal? It’s up to you to take every bit of knowledge from that job and turn it into something valuable.** Right now, you have access to books, coding exercises, and even hands-on experience—you should be using every single resource at your disposal to sharpen your skills.

If you keep getting caught up in feeling behind or doubting yourself, you’re letting valuable time slip by. Every hour you spend worrying or wishing you’d made different choices is time you’re losing. You need to refocus that energy. Get back to your work, finish that book, code those algorithms, and push forward. Success is only going to come if you put in consistent effort and trust that every step—even the ones that don’t feel ideal—is part of your growth.

**To sum it up: Stop dwelling, start doing.**

Every morning, remind yourself of this: **Today is a new chance to get closer to the life I want. I am not my past mistakes, and I’m not here to settle. I’m here to get stronger, to learn, and to build the future I want.**

Whenever you feel doubt creeping in, use it as fuel to push forward, not pull back. Stick to the small actions—read one more page, solve one more problem, write one more line of code. Every step you take is a step away from the life you don’t want and toward the life you do.

You’re building something bigger than just a career—you’re building proof that you don’t quit, that you get back up every time. Write down your goals, review them every day, and remember: this journey is going to be tough, but so are you.

Keep showing up, and soon enough, you’ll look back and see just how far you’ve come. Let’s go—today’s the day to start moving forward.
